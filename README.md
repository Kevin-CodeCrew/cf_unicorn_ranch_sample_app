# Sample Unicorn Ranch App Challenge

I wish it did more functionally but meets requirements as I understood them. Once I punted on initializing data at startup, rest was ez.

* I kludged up a solution to my data seed by just adding an endpoint to my constructor that can be hit with a GET request to seed an empty database
* I didn't bother to do full CRUD since wasn't required
